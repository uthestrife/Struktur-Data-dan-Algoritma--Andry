 * SDA1013.java
 *
 * This document belongs to Andry Luthfi. many thanks for some of my companions
 * whose taught me about data structure applied to this problem and many lesson
 * taught by my superior.
 *
 * This document containt :
 *  - Travel.class
 *  - Edge.class
 *  - Graph.class
 *
 * Thanks to :
 *      - Krishna Priawan Hardinda : as System Analyst and share about this
 *        assignment spesification.
 *      - Robeth Rahmatullah : teach me how to using some concept of backtracing
 *        in order to avoid Time Limit Exceed. and the using of
 *        traceBreadthFirstSearch method to initialization phase.
 *
 * Version:
 *  - 1.0 (3-December-2010):
 *      - build input process to adapt input pattern that given.
 *      - build Travel class, and Edge class that have been taught by Robeth
 *        Rahmatullah.
 *      - fix bug in input process
 *      - using Scanner and object out in System class, in order to knowing the
 *        brute force mode.
 *      - use tokenizer as solve the input pattern in city details
 *  - 1.1 (5-December-2010):
 *      - create Graph class, and implements every Algortithm that needed
 *      - develop traceBreadthFirstSearch method in order to assists solve the
 *        the given problem.
 *      - replace Scanner and out object which contained in System class, with
 *        BufferedWriter and BufferedReader class. to optimized the running time
 *        cost by input process in case the inputs are massive.
 *      - analyze and give documentation to every method with its complexity
